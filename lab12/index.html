			      <h1> Lab 12 Conditionals </h1>

					  <h2> Challenges </h2>
					    <p> For lab 12, we successfully created a simple conditional for our function "Sorting Hat."</p>
					  <h2> Difficulties </h2>
					    <p> We did not experience any difficulties as the lecture and assignment notes were straightforward and easy to follow. With our previous knowledge, we troubleshooted the published page to ensure that our code was working. </p>
					  <h2> Results </h2>
							<p> Overall, this lab has furthered our understanding of how text inputs and outputs work after submitting an answer. </p>

           <div class="<input-output">
             <h3>Welcome back to  Hogwarts!</h3>
             <p>Please enter your name for sorting</p>
             <input type="text" id="input">
             <button id="button">Submit</button>
