			<h1> Lab 3: File Structure </h1>
			<p> The main concept of this lab was to learn about how effective file structure is to html. Also to demonstrate how to make local file structures and how to create html or css files in that structure.</p>
			<h2> Difficulties </h2>
			<p> At first everything seemed straight foward until we reached embedding our images. We weren't completely sure what the problem was when putting our images in the website until we figured out that our image files weren't actually in the img folder. After we figured that out, we then struggled with creating a css file to edit those images within the website. The main issue was that we didn't know which css file was linked to this new html file and we were unsure how to link them together. </p>
			<h2> Results </h2>
