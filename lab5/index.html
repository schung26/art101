					<h2> Summary </h2>
					<p> This lab showed us how to use javascript in google. We entered the javascript code into the browser console and figured out how to declare and reference each variable. </p>
					<h2> Difficulties </h2>
					<p> We had a little trouble putting in the boolean variable because it seemed different than the others but we figured out that it was the same. Also at first, we weren't completely sure where to find the console for a website browser and it was different for the both of us since we have different computer types. We were able to solve this problem by watching the lecture again.</p>
					<h2> Results </h2>
