<h1> Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving </h1>
	<h2> Summary </h2>
	<p> The main concept of this lab was to learn how to pseudocode and everyday task before coding a computer task. This exercise taught us how to break down tasks in specific sections and subsections regarding the functions of that particular task.</p>
	<h2> Difficulties </h2>
			<p> The only difficulties we encountered were brainstorming which task to tackle. Once we figured out what computer task to focus on, we listed the basic rules then went into more detail. We weren't sure if we were typing in the javascript comments correctly. </p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
