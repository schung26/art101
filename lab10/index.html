			      <h1> Lab 10 Javascript Events and Forms </h1>

					  <h2> Challenges </h2>
					    <p>Our main challenges were trying to experiment with JS events which was the point of the lab. </p>
					  <h2> Difficulties </h2>
					    <p>This week's challenge presented a few difficulties that we tried to troubleshoot by reviewing the lecture notes. We had trouble with the nameSort() function as we did not understand what the purpose of this function was for. We also had a hard time trying to get the value of our input field. We successfully created the input field and submit input button but nothing happens after we enter a value, the name. Because we could not not figure out what the anagram function was for too, we couldn't save our results.</p>
					  <h2> Results
							<p> Overall, this lab was difficult for us because we weren't successful with most of our javascript. However, it was still a good learning experience as we messed around with different codes.
