	<h1> Lab 2 HTML & CSS </h1>
	<p> This paragraph will be about Sharon and Leola. Right now we are partners for lab 2 and probably for a while. We met in another class and were in the same group. We believe that we will work well together because we have similar work ethics and standards. One interesting thing about Leola is that she has five brothers and is the only girl out of all her siblings. One interesting thing about Sharon is... Hopefully we are doing this right! </p>
